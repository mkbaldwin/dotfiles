# dotfiles

This repository contains a collection of "dotfiles" that I use in my shell. 

## :warning: Warning

Use these scripts at your own risk. The settings it contains are specific to my preferences and the tools that I routinely have available on my computer. 
A best practice would be just to look at these files and create your own containing any if the settings / features you want for your own environment.
Your mileage may vary with these scripts.
